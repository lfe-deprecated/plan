# [yurrriq][]

### Blogging
* Re: [simple_cache][] from [Erlang and OTP in Action][] (ported to LFE)
* Re: Property-based testing with [PropEr][] and [PropL][]
  - How it helped with [Lodox][]

### Community
* Add more exercises to [xLFE][]
  - Get more contributors
  - Spread the word somehow
  - Get more people [on track][xLFE stats]
* Once [Lodox][] gets (more) stable, generate documentation for projects like:
  - [exemplar][]
  - [clj][] (as part of LFE proper)
  - [ltest][]
* Help ensure common lfex projects are using rebar3 and modern .travis.yml
* Modernize the Clojure code in [lfecljapp][]
* Help [oubiwann](#oubiwann) et al. write/edit documentation as needed

### Tools
* Some [Clojure mappings][clj] like [`condp`][]
* [Lodox][]: Documentation generator like [Codox][] for LFE
* [PropL][]: LFE wrapper for [PropEr][]
  - Consider adding support in [ltest][]
  - Make shell "property-tests" "behaviour as in ltest
* Further improvements to [Emacs integration][]
* [lfedn][]: lfe <-> edn
  - Polish and maybe use it in [lfecljapp][]
* Clean up [pynchon][]
  - Document it
  - Come up with some practical examples
